    Write a function that takes two hashes, merges them together, and returns the result. The hashes might contain integers, strings, arrays of integers, and other hashes (each of which might contain the same types of objects). When a duplicate key is found:

    * If the value is a string or integer, the value from the second hash should replace the value from the first
    * If the value is another hash, merge the two hashes together using these same rules.
    * If the value is an array, append the two arrays together.

    It's safe to assume that if a duplicate key is found, the values' type will be the same in both hashes.

    Arguments:
        hash1 {dict} -- Initial hash
        hash2 {dict} -- Update hash
